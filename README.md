Exit Notifier
=============

As per compliance guidelines, provides a notice whenever someone clicks a link to another site.

## Why this plugin?

A recommendation came to a client of mine who is subject to SOX compliance to add what they called a "speed bump" upon clicking a link that will take the user away from the client's website. I searched and found nothing that did what I was wanting to do, so here it is.

## How do I use it?

Installing "Exit Notifier" can be done either by searching for "Exit Notifier" via the "Plugins > Add New" screen in your WordPress dashboard, or by using the following steps:

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
2. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
